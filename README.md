<h1>Concepts</h1>
<p>This Repository has as function the gathering of concepts that are relevant on my learning journey. It will be updated with personal review and summarization of contents and the official material from my college studies. So this repository is basically a place to save my notes, my PDFs, e-books and whatever other source of doctrine/theory material that I gather to learn and review. This repository is not about a technology in specific, but about everything I'm currently studying or went through in my learning process, including some materials from my college studies that I didn't want to risk to lose but get able to review after a time</p> 
</br>
<p><strong>The following list is organised by folders, the folders name the topic of studies, not the name of the material (exception the folder Colleges - this folder has two subfolders and it's about my 2 bachelors and all the contents that I got as available for each discipline)</strong></p>
